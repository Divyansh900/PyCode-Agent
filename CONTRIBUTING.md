## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example Code Style

```python
def generate_code(self, prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Generate Python code based on the given prompt.
    
    Args:
        prompt (str): The user's request for code generation
        
    Returns:
        str: Generated Python code
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If prompt is empty or invalid
    """
    if not prompt.strip():
        raise ValueError("Prompt cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    return generated_code
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests

Examples:
```
